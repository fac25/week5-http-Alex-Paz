# Week 5 API Project

## Instructions: 
Select a country from the dropdown menu. 

A box will appear with some facts about that country as well as some news articles and the local time. 

## User Stories:
As a user, I want to:

- [x] See a mashup of news and some basic info of a searched country. 

- [x] View the app on all of my devices.


Stretch stories: 

- [x] As an impatient user, I want to see some indication that data is loading

- [x] As a confused user, I want to be told when something goes wrong

## Acceptance Criteria 


- [x] Query at least two APIs using fetch

- [x] Dynamic content generated with JS

- [ ] A clearly defined user journey, documented in your readme

- [x] A responsive, mobile-first design

- [ ] Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible

## Things to address

- Make a more specific error if the country doesn't have any facts.
